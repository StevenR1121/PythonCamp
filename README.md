Repository for University of Texas Permian Basin Engineering Camp

Untalizing Adafruits Circuit Playground Express- non Bluefruit ver. with Pyhton Bundle installed

included in the repository is the circuitpython 9.x bundle, exspasions on the led, ir, and motion sensing libraries

The pyhthon portion of the camp purpuse is to inspire young minds to create, and show what can be created with microcontrollers

the flow of my portion will start with understanding leds, so that the group can utalize alterntive methods of creating ui
and emplementing ways of using simple ui
after understanding how we will display our progress, we will utalize the ir sensors on the microcontorller to visualize
a game we are calling "the word game" it is a simple word guessing game like wheel of fortiom where the player guesses a letter
and a simple ui shows if that letter is in the chosen word. Following the word game the group will play a math based racing game.
Completing simple addition problems, will transmit a signal to the head board which, if the answer is correct, add a point on the
led strip. also included in our package is a game called "motion game." utalizing the motion sensor on the microcontroller, we wll
attempt a 3d flappy bird type game where a cube is controlled to go through on-coming blocks.

these demonstartions will create an insight into how microcontroller can be utlized to open up a creative workspace in programming
